                    <h1>MY STORY</h1>
                    <p>My story begins in Michigan in 1996. I was born in Grand Rapids and we lived there until 2000, when I was 4, to which my family and I then moved to Louisiana. We lived there for most of my childhood and then we moved here to Illinois and have lived here ever since.</p>

                    <p>Ever since I was a child, I remember drawing all the time. Even if I wasn't very good at it, I would just draw and draw. It didn't really matter WHAT I was drawing. I would draw cars, animals, etc.</p>
                            
                    <p>I never really thought about making art my career until I was around 12 or 13 years old. Then, I started wanting to get better and better at my artwork. I've been drawing ever since then.</p>
                            
                    <p>Now I'm 22 years old and I am pursuing a degree in Graphic Design with an interest in Graphic Illustration.</p>
